# odin-recipes

This project is a small book of recipes that I loved.

The technical purpose of it is to train my basic HTML skills by providing a connected structure between all the different pages in the book.

With this project I should be able to:
A - formulate a simple home webpage;
B - link images and videos;
C - deploy safe links to new tabs;
D - deploy some sort of navigability (back to home, next page, etc.);
E - share some recipes for anyone interested!
